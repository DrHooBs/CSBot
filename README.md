# Classcharts-Daily-Discord

  

Classcharts-Daily-Discord is a utility designed to be run once a day to fetch classcharts assignments and send them to a user on discord. I created this as the lack of notifications and reminders from the classcharts app frustrated me. As many of my peers also use discord this was a suitable solution

  

## Features

  

-  **Assignemnt Fetching**: Fetch assignments using classcharts api and send a DM to the user defined in `.env`

  

## Getting Started

  

### Prerequisites

  

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js

- npm

  

### Installation

  

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/DrHooBs/CSBot.git

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash

cd CSBot

```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash

npm install

```

  

### Configuration

  

1. Create a `.env` file from the template:

```bash

cp .envtemplate .env

```

2. Edit the `.env` file to include your specific settings.

  

### Usage

#### Run Once

Start the bot with:

```bash

npm  start

```

#### Automation

This script works best when run daily at either 08:00 or 16:30. Please follow the relevant section for automating on different platforms

First, create a new **systemd** timer unit file with a `.timer` extension.

```console

foo@bar:~$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/assignment.timer

```

Whilst in the nano editor add the following content:

```txt

[Unit]
Description=Discord Assignment Fetcher.

[Timer]
OnCalendar=Mon,Fri *-*-* 08:00:00

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

```

Next, create a service unit file that will correspond to the `.timer`. This should be in the same directory

```console

foo@bar:~$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/assignment.service

```

Whilst in the nano editor add the following content:

```txt

[Unit]
Description=Discord Assignment Fetcher.

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/repo/start.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.targer

```

Finally, enable and start the timer

```console

foo@bar:~$ sudo systemctl enable assignment.timer
foo@bar:~$ sudo systemctl start assigment.timer

```
